# GreenAi-Project-S7

## Form groups

- For this group project, constitute groups of 3 to 5, max 6 people.
    - If youprefer to bealone wecan makeexceptions but not everyone willbe
       able to do so, keepin mindthat beingalone makesmore work too.
- During the 3 first TD you will work on finding and realizing your
    subject + your presentation
       - You’re expected to take time to work on the subject outside of TD’s too.
       - Make use of TD’s to ask your questions.
- Your final presentation will make up for 75% of the module mark.


## First TD

- Find your subject, you can find resources on the last slide of CM5.
- Subjects should be somewhat related to Green AI.
    - Examples:
    - Forecasting greenhouse gas emissions: valid
    - Overview of an optimization technique (for example mixed precision training) and an impact
       on power consumption vs performance: valid(because shorter trainings = less consumption)
    - Forecasting the price of cryptocurrencies: invalid.
- Send an email to raphael.vienne@ext.devinci.fr with:
    - Your TD group number
    - The names of the participants of your group
    - Your subject name
    - Describe your data and what you’re going to do with it. (classification, clustering, regression,
       etc..)


## Second TD: deep dive

- Dive in your subject:
    - Analyze data and generate visualizations.
    - Develop a model that predicts something.
       - For complex models, you have GPUs available in Google Colab.
    - Evaluate the results of your model.


## Third TD: make your presentation

- Given your work from the first two TD’s (and outside of TDs too!):
1. Present your data
2. Show how your preprocessed data and how you built your model.
3. Show your results and some examples of your model’s predictions.
4. Explain what impact your model could have on sustainable
    development in general, green..


## During the presentation

- Depending on the number of groups we will decide later which time
    you have for your presentation
- It’s fundamental to understand your subject and what you did
    because a big part of the mark will be from questions at the end of
    your presentation.
       - That means, you can take and paste code online, but you better understand it
          in-depth.
